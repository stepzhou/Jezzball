Jezzball

Jezzball is a game that originally implemented in Java using the GridWorld package as my final project in high school.

I planned to re-implement it as an exercise to learn Python, but unfortunately never got past a problem with the game mechanics.

This will eventually be cleaned up (probably re-written) and completed.
