Jezzball
========

Jezzball is a game that originally implemented in Java using the GridWorld package as my final project in high school.

I planned to re-implement it as an exercise to learn Python, but unfortunately never got past a problem with the game mechanics.

I am finally getting around to finishing it. Though I am rewriting the game as
my Python style from 1+ year ago was not the greatest.
